##### **For several months now, I've been wanting to create my own website. The only problem? It had to follow a few criteria..**

---

To meet those criteria it needed to be:

###### **1. free**
* _because who has money to pay for a blog?_

###### **2. easy to use**
* _i don't want to spend more time troubleshooting than blogging._

###### **3. easy to host**
* _i don't need a cms, just gimme the web page!_

On advice from a colleague, I was suggested to try Jekyll.  A type of static web page generator, that would not only allow me to freely blog, but it would also allow supreme customization of the webpage, all without dedicating any resources to a traditional stack.  Best of all I could use Git Hub as both the host and the sites version control.

#### So what did it take?  
It only took a *good* reading of the [Git Hub Pages documentation](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcam://pages.github.com/), and a little research into [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Beyond the vanilla setup, I grabbed this [theme](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno) and away I went.
