#### For several months now, I've been wanting to create my own website. The only problem? It had to follow a few criteria..

##### It needed to be:

##### **1. free**
* **_because who has money to pay for a blog?_**

##### **2. easy to use**
* **_i am not a programmer._**

##### **3. easy to host**
* **_i don't need a cms, just gimme the web page!_**

On advice from a colleague, I was suggested to try Jekyll.  A type of static web page generator, that would not only allow me to scratch the itch of tech blogging, but it would also allow supreme customization of the webpage, without dedicating any resources to a traditional stack.  Best of all is that it's hosted on GitHub, as a Git Hub Page!

So after a lot Googling and a bit of praying, I've finally done it! I've claimed my own little part of the internet.
